The R-code show how I built my model, tested it, estimated out-of-sample-error and used it to predict the class of the 20 cases in "pml-testing.csv" the validation set. 

The comments tell why I made the choises I made. E.g. how I used cross validation and why I selected to use Random Forest to make the model.

## Load libraryes and set seed to get reproducable results
```
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(kernlab)
library(caret)
library(randomForest)

set.seed(1231) 
```
## Read training data
```
dta <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
```
First I got into truble with data.table and fread (stringsAsFactors) that did not play well with createDataPartition and randomForest. read.csv worked without tuning of arguments.

## Explore structure of training data (not values)
Visual inspection of:
```
str(dta)
names(dta)
unique(dta$classe)
unique(dta$user_name)
View(dta)
```
The data is a set of timeseries. Most of the variables are summary statistics based on the 
previous sensor data in the same time frame. Only lines with new_window=="yes" are summary lines. 

## Select variables 
To use the summary variables for prediction the test vectors need to be summary lines. We do not know that to be the case so that is why I chose only the variables present inn all lines. It turned out that none of the lines in the Validation set were summary lines, so that was a good choice. 
```
sumFet <- which(is.na(dta[23,])|dta[23,]=="") # See from observation that line 23 is not a summary line
dta <- dta[,-sumFet]
```
V1, user_name, raw_timestamp_part_1, raw_timestamp_part_2, cvtd_timestamp, new_window, num_window (variables [1:7]) are not sensor data, but related to how the experiment was conducted. The test set and probably the validation set are subsamples of the original training set.Using these experiment variables would probably give you a 100% prediction rate, but that would be a grose
overfitting. You could probably make a lookup table. The timestamps could have been used in an other context (E.g. summary data over time windows) but would have to be transformed to remove experiment related bias.

So I exclude [1:7] from training and prediction. For prediction I allso excluded "classe/problem_id" in prediction. 

## Explore structure of the remaining training data
```
tmp <- sapply(dta,function(x) sum(x=="#DIV/0!"))
tmp2 <- sapply(dta,function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
tmp3 <- sapply(dta,mean)
notNum <- which(is.na(tmp3)) # Not numerical variables
```
These values told me which variables could be used for calculations without modifications. It turned out to be alle the sensor variables.

## Split training and test (we have a validation set of size 20)
```
inTrain <-  createDataPartition(y = dta$user_name,p=0.80,list=FALSE) #Sampling considers user_name
training <- dta[inTrain,]
testing  <- dta[-inTrain,]
```

## Chose methode to build model
Given the nature of the data a desision tree should work: 
```
Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the 
front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) 
and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

```
I would expect a tree model that splits on variables indicating movments related to the different classes (A-E).

I chose Random forest which is more robust than a single tree.

## Train model and use cross validation 
Idealy I want a Leave-one-person-out Cross Validation with folds based on person (or maybe num_window) (6-fold (1 per person)). The data is a set of timeseries so it is natural to use folding. I did not have the time to find a good way of doing this. So I used a ordinary 6 folds cross validation. That also worked well.

Training the Random forrest model takes a LONNNNG time on my computer!
```
model <- train(classe ~ ., data=training[,8:60],method="rf",
               trControl=trainControl(method="cv",number=6),
               prox=TRUE,allowParallel=TRUE)
```

## Predict training set and estimate Out-of-sample-error
```
tanswers <- predict(model,newdata=testing[,8:59])
confusionMatrix(tanswers,testing$classe)

# Write answers to files for submission
```
